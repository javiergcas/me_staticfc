# Description

This is an ogoing project looking to derive new QA metrics for multi-echo fMRI data. In particular, it focused on exploiting some theoretical expectations about how functional connectivity should vary across echoes when data is dominated by different noise sources (e.g., net magnetization fluctuations, BOLD fluctuations, etc.).

# Preliminary results

Most notebooks in this project generate dynamic figures using holoviz libraries. These figures are intended to summarize key observations.

Below you can find links to these figures so you can explore them at your own pace.
